# ANSYS Mechanical Scripting

## Automated simuation and data generation using ANSYS Mechanical

The scripts here are used to simulate a soft robot based on a combination of Soft Pneumatic Actuators by applying various pressure inputs for each actuator, and saves the simulation videos and results (deformation, elastic strain) to create a soft robot dataset.

The code is run by ANSYS Mechanical, and thus, no virtual environment is needed. These scripts can be directly copied to ANSYS Mechanical after toggling the Scripting window and run as long as the model tree is setup correctly.
